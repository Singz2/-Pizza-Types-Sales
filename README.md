# -Pizza-Types-Sales
This repository contains a Python-based analysis of a year's worth of sales data from a fictitious pizza place, using the "Pizza+Place+Sales.zip" dataset. The project merges four CSV files—Orders, Order Details, Pizzas, and Pizza Types—to explore sales trends, customer preferences, and operational insights.
