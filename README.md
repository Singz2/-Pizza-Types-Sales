# -Pizza-Types-Sales
This repository houses a Python-driven examination of one year of sales records from a hypothetical pizza establishment, leveraging the "Pizza+Place+Sales.zip" dataset. The initiative integrates four CSV files—Orders, Order Details, Pizzas, and Pizza Types—to investigate sales patterns, customer preferences, and operational efficiencies.
